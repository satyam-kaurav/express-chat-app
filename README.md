this is a simple chat-app made using express js and socket.io only.
hosted on =>> https://express-chat-app-9d6e.onrender.com/

what it is
-> it server the html and js bundle from express static
-> don't have a database just using the server memory for tracking the lists. 

future scope
-> make it more robust so the normal bugs should be resolve like two client can request with same name
-> make the front-end a spa by reactjs.
-> add indexed db for client side storage.
-> add DB to the server side for more scalibilty and future advances
